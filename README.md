## üå≥ Bank Marketing Dataset: Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains **Task 3** of the **SkillCraft Data Analyst Internship**, focusing on applying **machine learning** techniques to predict customer purchase decisions using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral attributes.

## üìä Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a classification model:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and encoding categorical variables  
- Training and evaluating a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Visualizing results and understanding model performance  

It helped strengthen my knowledge of **supervised machine learning** and **predictive analytics**.

## üß† Tasks Overview

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the **Bank Marketing** dataset  
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features using **LabelEncoder** / **OneHotEncoder**  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  

### 2. Model Building
- Implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **Scikit-learn**  
- Tuned hyperparameters like `max_depth` and `criterion` to improve performance  

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model accuracy using metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report**
- Visualized the decision tree for interpretability  

### 4. Insights
- Understood key factors influencing customer decisions  
- Explored how demographic and behavioral variables impact marketing outcomes
